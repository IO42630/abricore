== Introduction

=== About

A `JPA` / `POJO` / `Selenium` investing bot.
It has `Services` which hold runtime data.
And `Jobs` which move data between resources, such as:
`DB` / `WEB` / `CSV`.

== Overview

==== Generic Template

If we were to add a new `Service` we would need to implement the blue Template Objects. +
If adding a `Job` implement the red Template Object instead.

====  Modules

Here is an overview of the modules and the types they exchange.

| `flow` | Application flow & logic. +
Issues start / stop commands to `Job`. +
Issues fetch / interrupt commands to `Navigator`. +
Issues update / stop commands to `Series`.

== Particularities

=== `Dao` vs `SlimDao`
==== Problem
* `SymbolDao` can *not* init its `AssetDto` fully, as this would require dep to `AssetService`.
- this would cause a circular dep.
- to show this `SymbolDao` is a `SlimDao`.
- instead, we place the custom init logic for `AssetDto` in the constructor of `AssetService`.
- this is _ok_ as long as `SymbolDao` is called from `AssetService` only.
* The remaining dao, e.g. `SnapShotDao`, init their dtos fully and thus are "full"-`Dao`.

== Runtime Lifecycle

==== OptionDto

The OptionDto Lifecycle has two stages.

1. *Discovery:*
According to our strategy we fetch a list of viable options.
However, this data set is missing some crucial entries.
We mark these options as `FOUND`.
2. *Details:*
For each `FOUND` option, we fetch the missing fields.
We then mark the options as `KNOWN`.
3. *Death:*
Options may expire or be knocked out.
When we fail to fetch a quote for an option, we mark the options as `DEAD`.

==== SnapShot

image::img/snap-lifecycle.png[]

* In a way Dto mimics Entity.
* `SnapshotEntity` has Unique Index on Instant/Asset.
* Therefore, SnapShotDto is hashed by Instant/Asset.
** We insist of working with Set<SnapShotDto>.
** This implies data loss (by pushing over an existing hash).
** Thus encouraging the usage of SnapShotDto.merge(SnapShotDto).
* The runtime data holder is a TreeMap<Instant, SnapShotDto>.
** It is filled via put(Set<SnapShotDto>).
** To do so, we:
*** Check if "newly pushed" SnapShotDto exists.
*** If yes we merge "newly pushed" into existing SnapShot.
*** If no we simply put.
