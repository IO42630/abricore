### what makes a good strategy


- a good strategy:
    - makes the maximum amount of money
    - and maximal probability
- the volume does not matter, as fees are accounted for by the model
- probability matters
    - the more data, on which the strategy performs well, the better



#### other quality measures

--
- on data, which is normalized by trend, the strategy places equal calls and puts.



# TODO
- is vector merge working?


# NOTES
* let trade-sq run ... see what happens
    * do debug the actual execute statements
